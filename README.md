## Tasks

For this project, I was given all of the front end code and I had to write the back end code. All of my work was done in the server.js file.

## What I Learned

This was one of the more challenging assignments for me, so I learned a lot in the process. The biggest things for me were knowing when my code is just looking at a filve versus when it's actually altering a file, and knowing whether or not something needed a json command.
